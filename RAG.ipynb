Thread tofu and vegetables on to barbecue skewers in alternating color  combinations: For example, first a piece of eggplant, then a slice of tofu, then zucchini, then red pepper, baby corn and mushrooms. Continue in this way until  all skewers are full. Make the marinade by putting all ingredients in a  blender, and blend on high speed for about one minute until mixed. Alternatively, put all ingredients in a glass jar, cover tightly with the lid  and shake well until mixed. Lay the kebabs in a long, shallow baking pan or on  a non-metal tray, making sure they lie flat. Evenly pour the marinade over the  kebabs, turning them once so that the tofu and vegetables are coated. Refrigerate the kebabs for three to eight hours, occasionally spooning the  marinade over them. Broil or grill the kebabs at 450 F for 15-20 minutes, or on the grill, until the vegetables are browned. Suggestions  This meal can be served over cooked, brown rice.

       "  'recipeinstructions': \"Procedure: Mash for 90 minutes at 160°F. We did two 1.5 gallon batches, each spiced differently (one with curacao/coriander, the other with allspice/cinammon). We would rather have used a higher proportion of jora, but on brewday we discovered that our ability to determine the weight of things is seriously imparied. Instead of the 4.5lbs we thought we had, we found we had only 3lbs of jora. Rather than readjust (the OG would have been more appropriate at ~1.045 in any case), we added more sugar, a course of action that was inspired by homebrewed Weizen as much as anything else. The result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle. Be warned that chicha is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains some sweetness and body. Once the chicha ferments out, you are left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more than anything else. If I'd been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping), I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?) In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes. Specifics:  OG: 1.055  FG: 1.012 Types of Chicha So far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. These range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with. Facil (easy) - Corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germinate. The sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor. Abbreviated - The jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off. Traditional - Similiar to the Abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling. Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom. This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted). The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens. Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles. Also note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge. That is, the sweet liquor (upi) is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash. Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditional nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed). Chicha is traditionally allowed to spontaneously ferment. For the last type (Modern), George Duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn. This gooey mass would then be added to more water and barley malt and mashed as per 'normal' homebrew procedures. This could probably be sparged as usual.\"},\n",

Brush the sides of a 8 x 3 1/4-inch  springform pan with the melted butter. Mix together 1/2 cup sugar, cinnamon,  nutmeg, and 1/4 cup flour and sprinkle the mixture evenly over the bottom of  the pan. Wrap foil around the pan to prevent leakage. Starting at the outside  edge, arrange a ring of apple slices in the pan, slightly overlapping and  pointing to the center. (It will feel backwards.) Fill in the center with  another circle of apples, with some overlap occurring. Layer any remaining  apple slices evenly, overlapping to prevent the batter from escaping. With a  wooden spoon or electric mixer, beat together the butter and 1 cup sugar. Add  the eggs, milk, rum, and vanilla. The batter will look curdled. Add 1 1/4  cups flour, the nuts, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, beating only  until the flour is completely incorporated. Pour the batter over the apples  and spread evenly. Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake in the middle of  the oven until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, about 70  minutes. Cover with a piece of foil if the top begins to brown too quickly. Let the cake rest in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes, then, using a small,  flexible knife, gently separate the sides of the cake from the pan. Invert  the cake on the rack, letting it stay in the pan for another 10 minutes, then  remove the pan, lifting it up carefully.'},\n",

The water should be added to the flour slowly to ensure that only the minimum amount of water is used. Do not over-mix the dough. When the dough has been mixed just sufficiently to combine the ingredients, form it into a ball and wrap in a piece of plastic wrap and refrigerate for several  hours. To prepare the filling, melt the butter in a large saute pan until it  begins to brown. Add the sliced apples and cook over medium heat until they begin to soften, about 2 to 3 minutes. In a bowl, combine the lemon juice, sugars, Southern Comfort, and  cinnamon. Add this mixture to the apples and cook 2 to 3 minutes over medium-high heat until the apples are completely caramelized and covered with all the sugar. Remove filling from the heat and  allow to cool. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. When ready to use, remove the dough from the refrigerator, lightly flour a pastry board and a rolling pin, and unwrap the dough. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and begin to roll out into a circle by rolling evenly outward from the center and turning   the dough in small 1/8th turns to keep the rolling even. When the  dough is  rolled out to an even thickness and is about 12 inches in  diameter and 1/8-inch thick, it is ready to be transferred to a 10-inch pie pan or plate. Lightly butter the pie plate, partially roll the dough up on the rolling pin, lift the dough and center it in the pie pan and unroll. Roll the second half of the pie dough into a round slightly larger than the pie pan. Fill the bottom crust with the cooked apples using a slotted spoon to drain the apples. Reserve juices if desired, for sauce. Brush an egg wash coating over the lip of the dough. This is where it will be sealed to the top  crust. Cover the apples  with the top half of the pie dough. Trim any excess  from the top  crust before using both hands to crimp the edges of the two crust together to seal. With a sharp knife, make several crosshatch slits in the top  crust. Brush with the egg wash and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool 20 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream. Reserved juices can be reduced with heavy cream for a sauce for the pie.'},\n",

There is no need to bone  the chicken. Put about 1/4 inch water in the slow cooker. Rinse the chicken  well, getting into the crevices, and sprinkle with the Cajun seasoning on both  sides. Go easy at first; this is NOT low-salt and it tends to be a little spicy. I start immediately placing the chicken in the slow cooker. I rinse one piece,  season both sides, and layer it in the pot. When you are done seasoning all the  chicken (I generally do 2-3 lbs in a batch; less is not worth the time), cover  the pot and let the chicken stand for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, cover the chicken fully with water (don't skimp) and set the cooker on \\\\  Cooking time is up to you. A minimum of 8-10 hours is what I recommend.  I  usually set the chicken cooking in an afternoon, and let it cook overnight.  Often it will cook for 12-24 hours. This is an excellent dish for those of us  who never learned to properly debone a chicken ;) At the end of the cooking  time, merely pull out the chicken pieces and separate the bones from the meat.  It will literally fall apart. Save the broth for adding to mashed potatoes,  gravy, rice or soup. You will have a good deal of chicken here. Separate into  smaller portions and freeze.\"},\n",

While the oil is heating, prepare the round steaks by dredging them in the flour spice, taking care to evenly coat the meat. Shake off any  excess. Dip the meat into the batter, and then again in the flour  spice, evenly coating the batter so it is dry on the outside. When  the oil temperature reaches 350 degrees (when a drop of batter sizzles when dropped in it), gently slide one steak into the hot oil. Cook the steak about 5 minutes. Turn in, taking care not to break  the coating, and cook the meat 5 more minutes, or until the batter is nicely browned. Drain the cooked steak on paper towels. Repeat with the other steaks. Hold the cooked steaks in a 225 degree oven until all four are done. Pour Cracker-Pepper Gravy over the steaks and serve. Yield: 4 servings. CREAM GRAVY Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan. When the foam goes down, whisk in the flour. Continually whisk until the flour cooks, becoming a fragrant light brown. Slowly add the milk, continuing to whisk to  keep lumps from forming.

       "  'recipeinstructions': \"In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the yolks with the vanilla extract.  Whisk in half the sugar and continue to beat until very light and  frothy, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and cornstarch and sift  once to aerate. In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites with the  salt until they hold a very soft peak. Beating faster, add the  remaining sugar in a very slow stream, beating until the egg whites  hold a firm peak. Fold the yolks into the whites. Sift the flour and  cornstarch over the eggs in 3 additions, folding them in gradually. Do not over-mix the batter. Pour the batter into a buttered and  paper-lined 9- or 10-inch round pan, 2-inches deep and smooth the  top. Bake the Pan di Spagna at 350 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes,  until it is well risen and feels firm when pressed gently with the  palm of the hand. Immediately loosen the layer from the side of the  pan with a small knife or spatula. Invert the layer and leave the  paper stuck to it. Turn the layer right side up and cool it on a rack. Double-wrap the layer in plastic and keep it in the refrigerator up to  5 days or freeze it. Variations: Flavor the batter with a grated  orange or lemon zest or a tablespoon of Anisette. For the chocolate filling, bring the cream to a boil and remove the  heat. Add finely cut chocolate, stir once and let stand for 3  minutes. Whisk smooth, pour into a bowl and cool until set, several  hours at a cool room temperature. Set aside. For the syrup, bring  sugar and water to a boil in a small pan. Cool and stir in  Maraschino. For the pistachios, place in a pan and cover with  water. Bring to a boil, drain and rub in a towel to loosen skins. Go over pistachios to separate from skins. Place pistachios on a jelly  roll pan and dry out at 325 degrees about 5 minutes. Cool and  chop coarsely. To prepare the layers, cut the Pan di Spagna into 5  thin horizontal slices. Reserve 2 of the slices, then cut the other  slices into smaller disks, each 1-inch smaller in diameter then the  reserved 2, to make a 9, 8-, and 7-inch disk. Reserve scraps. To  finish the filling, beat the butter by machine until soft and light, then  beat in the cooled chocolate mixture all at once. Beat again until  light, then beat in the Maraschino. Stir in half of the chopped  pistachios. To assemble, place one of the 10-inch layers on a  platter or cardboard and moisten with the syrup. Spread the filling. Continue with the remaining layers. After spreading the 7-inch layer  with the filling, form a 6-inch layer with the scraps on top of it. Moisten the 6-inch layer and spread the entire outside of the cake  with the filling. Cut a slash from the center to the edge of the  reserved 10-inch layer and cover the entire outside of the cake with  it. Moisten with the remaining syrup and spread with the remaining  filling. Press the reserved pistachios all over the outside of the  cake. Dust lightly with the confectioners' sugar.\"},\n",

As far as I know it is  relatively original, or as original as any type of recipe such as this can be. It is not only addictive and decadent but pretty to look at as  well. This is a special occasion dessert. Whisk yolks in a medium saucepan. Gradually add sugar, whisking until  mixture is thick and lemon colored, about 1 or 2 minutes. Blend in whole milk,  whipping cream and cornstarch; mix. Place over medium low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens, about 3 to 5 minutes. DO NOT BOIL  OR MIXTURE WILL SEPARATE. Remove from heat and stir until slightly cooled. Blend in vanilla and nutmeg. Transfer to a bowl; repeat process for the  two required for the trifle. ASSEMBLY: Whip the cream as your MaMa or Daddy taught you to do. In your  prettiest large crystal bowl (salad bowl size) place a little less than  half the whipped cream around the bottom and half way up the sides. Break 1/2 of the cakes into bite sized pieces and drop randomly all over the  cream. Drizzle sherry over all. Drop dollops of jam and slightly less  than half of the drained raspberries over the cake. Drizzle 1/2 of the  thick but liquid custard over all. Repeat for the next layer, reserving  some raspberries for the top. (Try to plan to end with a layer of jam and  raspberries as the top of the Trifle.) Finally, completely cover the top  with the remaining whipped cream. Drizzle a little chocolate on top in any  pattern you think looks good. Add a few raspberries and stand back to receive raves. To serve, merely scoop down and place on a pretty  plate. NOTE: Make about 4 hours before serving. Cover with plastic wrap and  refrigerate.'},\n",

Bring the water to a boil in the saucepan. Remove from heat; add 3 cups of sugar, stirring until dissolved. Slowly add the remaining sugar, reheating the water if necessary. When all the sugar is dissolved, pour the mixture into 3 heat proof jars or glasses. Stir 3 drops of liquid food coloring and 1/2 teaspooon candy flavoring into each jar. Tie each length of string around a pencil. Lay one string on top of each jar so the strings hang down into the liquid. Crystals will begin to form in 1 hour, and continue to solidify for several days. If a layer forms on the surface of the jar, break it. When liquid completely evaporates, candy is ready.'},\n",

However,  a good stiff shove to the bottom with a wooden spoon of the tomatoes  that are floatin to the top tryin to get away from the Jalapenos will help  things along quite nicely. All you wanna do is get them broken into large  pieces and mixed thoroughly. No more than fifteen seconds on total. This should be about a Quart and a half. I would recommend you put this  Gem in Glass jars and Lid/ring them and refrigerate for a while but it is  ready right now just gets better after sittin a spell. It'll keep a week or so  in the icebox, most likely won't last that long anyhow. Only problem,  which I have a solution to, Is that after a period of time there is so much  acid in this it starts attacking the metal lid/ring. Solution: I have recently  come across some rather sturdy white plastic screw on lids by \\\\   (r) that work very well.\"},\n",

       "  'recipeinstructions': 'First make the tomato sauce: peel and mince onions. Saute onions in 2 Tbsp oil  and 2 Tbsp butter, over moderate heat, until they are soft and lightly colored  (about 8 minutes). Add mush- rooms and saute. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste,  wine, parsley, seasonings and sugar. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered,  for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, and the mixture is quite thick. Remove skillet from heat and let it  cool completely. Start seasoning the eggplants: peel eggplants and slice vertically, 1/8 to 1/4  inch thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit for 30 minutes. Now make the  Bechamel Sauce.  NOTE:  The Bechamel-egg-ricotta mixture will overflow all but the largest  (professional size) food processors. Use a mixer or blend by hand.Place the milk in a saucepan, and heat it just until tiny  bubbles appear along the edges. Remove and set aside. Melt the butter in 3-quart saucepan over very low heat until foamy, being careful not to brown. Slowly add the 6 Tbsp flour, stirring constantly until smooth (3-4 minutes), and  still being careful not to let it brown. Add the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk. When the mixture is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in seasonings. Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth  and creamy. Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce. Stir in beaten eggs until  thoroughly incorporated. Back to the eggplant: Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and pat dry. Dredge the eggplant in 1 1/2 cups flour, and saute each in olive oil until it is  brown on both sides. Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the  top of the tomato mixture. Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan that is at least 3  inches deep, and sprinkle the bottom with a few breadcrumbs. Place a layer of  eggplant in the pan, following with a layer of tomato mixture. Sprinkle with  breadcrumbs and grated cheese. Repeat as many times as you have eggplant to  last. Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 deg. F for  one hour, or until a golden-brown crust has formed on top. Remove moussaka from  oven and let it stand undisturbed 20-30 minutes; the delay allows the layers to  fuse. '},\n",

Place the tomato wedges around the bottom  outer edge of the lettuce.  Place the cucumber fingers in-between the  tomatoes standing upright on the lettuce.  Put avocado around the same way so  you have tomato, cucumber, avocado repeating all round. Place the 4 fetas  around  the top in a circle.  Add the beets on the feta and the shrimp on the beet.

Season with 1/4 tsp of the salt, the marjoram and the pepper. Set aside to cool. Preheat oven to 450°F. In a food processor bowl place flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and the remaining salt; mix. Add the shortening and process just until it is the texture of soft crumbs. Add the milk and mix quickly to form a soft dough. Oil a 10 inch round cake pan and lightly use your fingers to spread the dough out evenly. Spread the cooked onion over the top. Beat the egg and sour cream together. Spoon the mixture over the onion, and spread it out to the very edge of the pan. Sprinkle lightly with poppy seeds and paprika. Bake for 20 minutes. Let cool slightly, then cut into wedges.'},\n",
