33,69,Chicha Peruana,1 1/2 1 1,"[""lb"",""lb""]",piloncillo cone Nottingham dry yeast,21.1,0.3,2.7,1.5,2.7,"Procedure: Mash for 90 minutes at 160Â°F. We did two 1.5 gallon batches, each spiced differently (one with curacao/coriander, the other with allspice/cinammon). We would rather have used a higher proportion of jora, but on brewday we discovered that our ability to determine the weight of things is seriously imparied. Instead of the 4.5lbs we thought we had, we found we had only 3lbs of jora. Rather than readjust (the OG would have been more appropriate at ~1.045 in any case), we added more sugar, a course of action that was inspired by homebrewed Weizen as much as anything else. The result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle. Be warned that chicha is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains some sweetness and body. Once the chicha ferments out, you are left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more than anything else. If I'd been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping), I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?) In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes. Specifics:  OG: 1.055  FG: 1.012 Types of Chicha So far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. These range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with. Facil (easy) - Corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germinate. The sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor. Abbreviated - The jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off. Traditional - Similiar to the Abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling. Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom. This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted). The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens. Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles. Also note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge. That is, the sweet liquor (upi) is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash. Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditional nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed). Chicha is traditionally allowed to spontaneously ferment. For the last type (Modern), George Duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn. This gooey mass would then be added to more water and barley malt and mashed as per 'normal' homebrew procedures. This could probably be sparged as usual."

The water should be added to the flour slowly to ensure that only the minimum amount of water is used. Do not over-mix the dough. When the dough has been mixed just sufficiently to combine the ingredients, form it into a ball and wrap in a piece of plastic wrap and refrigerate for several  hours. To prepare the filling, melt the butter in a large saute pan until it  begins to brown. Add the sliced apples and cook over medium heat until they begin to soften, about 2 to 3 minutes. In a bowl, combine the lemon juice, sugars, Southern Comfort, and  cinnamon. Add this mixture to the apples and cook 2 to 3 minutes over medium-high heat until the apples are completely caramelized and covered with all the sugar. Remove filling from the heat and  allow to cool. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. When ready to use, remove the dough from the refrigerator, lightly flour a pastry board and a rolling pin, and unwrap the dough.

When you are done seasoning all the  chicken (I generally do 2-3 lbs in a batch; less is not worth the time), cover  the pot and let the chicken stand for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, cover the chicken fully with water (don't skimp) and set the cooker on \  Cooking time is up to you. A minimum of 8-10 hours is what I recommend.

In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites with the  salt until they hold a very soft peak. Beating faster, add the  remaining sugar in a very slow stream, beating until the egg whites  hold a firm peak. Fold the yolks into the whites. Sift the flour and  cornstarch over the eggs in 3 additions, folding them in gradually. Do not over-mix the batter. Pour the batter into a buttered and  paper-lined 9- or 10-inch round pan, 2-inches deep and smooth the  top.

Immediately loosen the layer from the side of the  pan with a small knife or spatula. Invert the layer and leave the  paper stuck to it. Turn the layer right side up and cool it on a rack. Double-wrap the layer in plastic and keep it in the refrigerator up to  5 days or freeze it. Variations: Flavor the batter with a grated  orange or lemon zest or a tablespoon of Anisette. For the chocolate filling, bring the cream to a boil and remove the  heat. Add finely cut chocolate, stir once and let stand for 3  minutes. Whisk smooth, pour into a bowl and cool until set, several  hours at a cool room temperature. Set aside. For the syrup, bring  sugar and water to a boil in a small pan. Cool and stir in  Maraschino. For the pistachios, place in a pan and cover with  water. Bring to a boil, drain and rub in a towel to loosen skins. Go over pistachios to separate from skins. Place pistachios on a jelly  roll pan and dry out at 325 degrees about 5 minutes. Cool and  chop coarsely. To prepare the layers, cut the Pan di Spagna into 5  thin horizontal slices. Reserve 2 of the slices, then cut the other  slices into smaller disks, each 1-inch smaller in diameter then the  reserved 2, to make a 9, 8-, and 7-inch disk. Reserve scraps. To  finish the filling, beat the butter by machine until soft and light, then  beat in the cooled chocolate mixture all at once. Beat again until  light, then beat in the Maraschino. Stir in half of the chopped  pistachios. To assemble, place one of the 10-inch layers on a  platter or cardboard and moisten with the syrup. Spread the filling. Continue with the remaining layers. After spreading the 7-inch layer  with the filling, form a 6-inch layer with the scraps on top of it. Moisten the 6-inch layer and spread the entire outside of the cake  with the filling. Cut a slash from the center to the edge of the  reserved 10-inch layer and cover the entire outside of the cake with  it. Moisten with the remaining syrup and spread with the remaining  filling. Press the reserved pistachios all over the outside of the  cake. Dust lightly with the confectioners' sugar."

When the mixture is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in seasonings. Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth  and creamy. Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce. Stir in beaten eggs until  thoroughly incorporated. Back to the eggplant: Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and pat dry. Dredge the eggplant in 1 1/2 cups flour, and saute each in olive oil until it is  brown on both sides. Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the  top of the tomato mixture. Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan that is at least 3  inches deep, and sprinkle the bottom with a few breadcrumbs. Place a layer of  eggplant in the pan, following with a layer of tomato mixture. Sprinkle with  breadcrumbs and grated cheese. Repeat as many times as you have eggplant to  last. Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 deg.
